architectureExample
===================

An example for some architecture discussion and experiments.

The application is a small game in which the player enters english words and gets points dependent on the length of these words.

As you can see in the package structure, three people are implementing parts of this game. Over time, we experiment with different implementations and analyse what effects our decisions have.
